# About TV App backend 
This is the custom PHP backend made for Android application.

# Where I got that backend from?
I got that from Bikash Thapa's Github repo called:
- [livetv-streaming-php-backend](https://github.com/bikashthapa01/livetv-streaming-php-backend)
- And I customized that backend to my own needs.
